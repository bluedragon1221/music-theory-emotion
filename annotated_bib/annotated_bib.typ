= #cite(label("structureAndFunction"), form: "full")
- *Source Credibility:*
  - *Currency:* The source is from 1965, but, the topic of music theory hasn't change in a long time.
  - *Relevant:* The topic of the essay is the structure of music, which pertains to my topic.
  - *Authority:* Milton Babbit is a renowned composer, as well as having a degree from Princeton University
  - *Accuracy:* The source is biased against composers who compose on pure intuition as opposed to using structure and theory.
  - *Purpose:* Milton argues that music theory should be taught more rigorously, and that music theory should approach the structure of music, not just its function.
- *Key Quotes:* "I like to believe that a not insignificant consequence of the proper understanding of a proper theory of music is to assure that a composer who asserts something such as: "I don't compose by system, but by ear" thereby convicts himself of, at least, an _argumentum ad populum_ by equating ignorance with freedom, that is, by equating ignorance of the constraints under which he creates with freedom from constraints. In other words, musical theory must provide not only the examination of the structure of musical systems - familiar and unfamiliar by informal conditioning - as a connected theory derived from statements of significant properties of individual works, a formulation of the constraints of such systems in a "creative" form (in that, as a language grammar does for sentences, it can supply the basis for unprecedented musical utterances which, nevertheless, are coherent and comprehensible) , but - necessarily prior to these - an adequately reconstructed terminology to make possible and to provide a model for determinate and testable statements about musical compositions"
  - "I don't compose by system, but by ear" This statement represents that some composers claim that they only use intuition when they write music
  - "ignorance of the constraints under which he creates with freedom from constraints" Babbitt believes that all musical composition, whether consciously or not, has music theory behind it. Claiming to be free from these constraints simply means the composer is unaware of them, not that they don't exist.
- *Perspective:*
  - Musical education should encompass the overall structure of music, not just indivitual turns or progressions
  - Every piece of music has theory behind it, and saying that it doesn't means that you just don't understand the theory

  - "Music has a prominent role in the everyday life of many people. Whether it is for recreation, distraction or mood enhancement, a lot of people listen to music from early in the morning until late at night, especially since the invention of radio and recordings. Because of its near ubiquity, music has been identified as important in the construction of autobiographical memories and thus for making judgments about oneself and others."
  - "Emotional music we have heard at specific periods of our life is strongly linked to our autobiographical memory and thus is closely involved in forming our view about our own self."
  - "The results of this study revealed that recovery of verbal memory and focused attention improved significantly in the group of patients who listened to their favorite music on a daily basis compared with the patients who listened to audio books or received no listening material (control group)."

  - *Purpose:* The article aims to identify the neural substrates underlying aesthetic musical emotions. It is intended for a scientific audience.
- *Key Quotes:*
  - "Music evokes complex emotions beyond pleasant/unpleasant or happy/sad dichotomies usually investigated in neuroscience."
  - "Positive emotions correlated with activation of left striatum and insula when high-arousing (Wonder, Joy) but right striatum and orbitofrontal cortex when low-arousing (Nostalgia, Tenderness)."
  - "Irrespective of their positive/negative valence, high-arousal emotions (Tension, Power, and Joy) also correlated with activations in sensory and motor areas, whereas low-arousal categories (Peacefulness, Nostalgia, and Sadness) selectively engaged ventromedial prefrontal cortex and hippocampus."
- *Perspective:*
  - Music can evoke a wide range of complex emotions, including joy, sadness, tension, wonder, peacefulness, power, tenderness, nostalgia, and transcendence. 
  - These emotions are associated with distinct patterns of brain activity. For example, joy is associated with activation in the left striatum and insula, while sadness is associated with activation in the right parahippocampal cortex and subgenual anterior cingulate cortex. 
  - The neural correlates of aesthetic musical emotions are similar to those of other basic emotions, such as happiness and sadness. However, there are also some important differences. For example, aesthetic musical emotions are more likely to involve the activation of brain regions involved in memory and self-reflection.

- *Key Quotes:*
  - "It is a selective, artificial version of history—very much like the politics of nostalgia that are in vogue today."
  - "That is a false promise, because we can't go back—and even if we could, we wouldn't find what we were looking for. It was never there and, in any case, would not be able to give us the solution to our current problems."
  - "Was it by chance the one incredibly short period in mankind's history when you were alive and, more importantly, young?"
- *Perspective:*
  - People's nostalgic feelings are often tied to their own youth.
  - The "good old days" were never as good as they seem in retrospect. 
  - Every generation has believed that the present is worse than the past.
