// How do musicians across diverse genres utilize specific musical techniques to evoke emotional response in listeners?

// Implicit Introduction
Have you ever listened to a song and felt something?
Maybe the song made you sad, or scared, or gave you goosebumps.
Throughout all genres of music, artists utilize different techniques to create emotion in their songs.
In this essay, I will address some of these techniques and explain how you can realize them next time you are listening to a song.

== Background
Before we dig deep into music theory, you need to understand some basics.

what is a chord? maj, min, dim

chords have letter names and number names

7 chords? maj7, min7, 7

Resolutions: sus4, 7

== Chords and Chord Progressions
One common way that musicians evoke emotion is through the chords they use.

=== Relative Minors
The phrase "relative minor" refers to the minor that is related to a given major chord.
Relative minors tend to evoke a similar, yet darker feel than their major counterparts

ex. Guiding Light - Muse

//   note: [The use of the minor chord ($"Am"^7$) in measure 5]
// )

=== vi IV I V
ex. Bleeding Out - Imagine dragons

ex. Sky High - Electronomia (intro)

=== Pachelbel
There are many songs that use the chord progression popularized by Pachelbel in his Canon in D.
Pop songs such as Memories by Maroon 5 and Past Lives by Børns are some examples of this chord progression.



=== IV iii I V7
ex. Alive - Virtual Riot

ex. Clocks - Coldplay (modified, but same idea)


== Melodies
ex. Bass line in It Is Well With My Soul - Leads to relative minor

== Structure
If a song just kept doing the same thing for the whole song, it would get boring quickly.

While popular music theory education tends to focus on a more zoomed in view, such as we have done throughout the essay so far,
Milton Babbit @structureAndFunction argues that music theory should encompass the overall structure of the piece as well.

=== "Drops"
In electronic music genres, such as EDM, House, and Dubstep, it is common to build up to a point using drums and bass sounds, then "drop," or switch to a louder, more complicated sound.

Many of these build-ups are achieved through filtering the sound.
High Pass filters, for example, allow only higher pitches to come through, making the music fade out.

Sidechaining is another technique used in drops.
Sidechaining is when producers make instruments or vocals "duck," or get quieter, when the kick drum hits.
This can be used in drops to make the drums sound louder, building intensity even more before the drop.

=== Rhythmic Intensity

In classical music, such as works by Beethoven and Mozart, the music will get faster and slower at points.
This is known as "modulation in rhythmic intensity."

One good example of this is in Beethoven's Sonata Pathétique.
The piece starts off slow, but later has a section with rapid octaves, which creates a fast and energetic feel.
